When attempting to drag a file or folder straight from finder into the dock, you might be suprised to discover that this does not work. Quite strange when you consider most actions in macOS are very much drag-drop oriented.

However, not being able to simply drag a file into the dock doesn't mean it is impossible. Here's how to do it:

> [!TIP]
> Pressing `control` + `shift` + `⌘` + `T` is the keyboard shortcut for "Add to Dock" when a file or folder is highlighted in Finder!

1. Within finder navigate to the file or you'd like to pin to the dock.
2. In the global menu click on the `File` menu option while holding down the `shift` key on the keyboard.
3. Click the *Add to Dock* option and the file or folder will now be pinned to the dock!
