# Combining multiple files into a PDF on Mac

I found a backup of an old NES manual where someone had scanned each page separately and then bundled all the images in a single `.zip` file. For my purposes I wanted to have all the images in a single PDF though. Luckily you can quickly combine multiple files into a PDF right from your desktop or a finder window.

Here's how to do it:

1. Select the files you want to combine
2. Right-click the selected files and then choose quick actions
3. From the quick actions menu select `Create PDF`.zip

That's it! Enjoy your new PDF document 😎
